# project21

This is a small searchable database created with JHIPSTER.
The idea was to be able to search a directory of directors, movies, and its viewer rating.

Features include:

To add, update, and delete movies on a NOSQL database via REST API calls.
To display search results which are sorted according to the date they are modified.

To run you will need:
Gradle / NPM / Java 8 / MongoDB
